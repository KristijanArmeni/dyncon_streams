### ABOUT 

This repository hosts the code that was used for analysis pipeline in the project _MEG spectral correlates of lexical perplexity and entropy during auditory story comprehension_ (codename: streams)

### Directory structure

* matlab (meg analysis pipeline)
  * external (external code)
* language (for processing language stimuli used in the experiment)
* ploting (code for ploting the results)

### Toolboxes used

The pipeline relies on the following software toolboxes and software:

* [Fieldtrip][Fieldtrip] (for MEG data analysis)
* [Freesurfer][Freesurfer] (for cortical sheet reconstruction in source analysis)
